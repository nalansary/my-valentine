                        actually comes, it feels impossible to move. You’re not lazy, and you’re not weak—your brain is
                        just clinging to what feels safe and familiar. But you can break this cycle, even if it feels
                        difficult right now.

                        The first thing to do is stop thinking, start moving. Don’t wait to “feel” ready. Just
                        physically get up, grab your bag, put your shoes on. Don’t let your brain debate it—just do the
                        next step, then the next.</div>
